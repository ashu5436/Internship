I barely get 1 signal bar in the living room (useful only for light internet usage such as checking mails). As I'm getting a new internet (non ADSL) connection, I needed a new WiFi router. As this router has two 5dBi antennae, I was expecting a better coverage from it. However, I found that it's signal strength is weaker than the Zyxel router. The signal barely reaches the third bedroom and the signal reaches only intermittently to the living room (not workable at all). I was disappointed to notice that this router’s signal is weaker than my existing router. I even used WiFi analyzer app to compare the signal strengths of this router with that of my old Zyxel router. The comparison confirmed my observation that this router’s signal is weaker than my old router.<br><br>Just a note, the router, I received, has only 8 LED indicators and not 9 as shown in the picture. It’s manufactured in Sep 2014. A reviewer on another site mentioned that, he had ordered two of these routers and got 1 router with 8 LEDs and the other router with 9 indicators and noticed that the router with 8 LEDs has very poor signal coverage compared with the other router.<br><br>I’m giving it 2 stars because the setup was easy and the router worked (even though it covers only 1 room properly).<br><br>I’m returning the product as it does not meet my expectation.\",\n",

I recently moved to ACT fibernet with comparable internet speeds of 42 mbps average (both download and upload). Apparently, my Linksys WRT 54 G could not deliver this speed. It could do a max of 14 mbps :( ... you know its G band after all. In practical terms, G routers can do 15 Mbps vs theoretical 54 Mbps.<br><br>I wanted to move to N band router (theoretical 300 Mbps) and wanted to touch the waters and I landed up with TP Link WR841N 300Mbps. Following is my feedback:<br><br>First Impression Out of the Box:<br>Poor plastic grade. However, the fit and finish was adorable despite the poor plastic appearance &amp; feel.<br><br>Speed - Did I get my anticipated wireless 42 Mbps speed based on my ACT fiber provider?<br>Answer: Yes &amp; No<br>2 Feet - Full speed 42 Mbps internet. -- Signal Bar: Full 5<br>5 Feet - 37 Mbps – 5 Bar<br>10 Feet - 20 Mbps – 5 Bar<br>15 Feet - 15 Mbps – 5 Bar<br>20 Feet - 10 Mbps – 4 or 5 Bar<br>25 Feet - 5 Mbps – 3 or 4 Bar<br>30 Feet – 3 to 5 Mbps – Almost Dead<br><br>No walls in between. Tested under line of sight conditions. Tested on free channels with various settings.<br><br>In a way, this device is like a wife like material. You need to be close enough to get all the attention and at all times (Just kidding, no offence meant).<br><br>I flashed the DD WRT firmware (with careful instructions) and I played around with all combinations to optimize the experience and there had been no significant change. This means, the hardware has already done its best. We cannot ask a Tiger to run like a Cheetah, can we? :)<br><br>One important factor: There was not a single dropout or restart and it’s a stable device (tested for a week).<br><br>Value for Money? In my opinion, I think this device has performed for what I have paid for. Can’t expect more.<br><br>What Next? For folks who want solid performance (range + speed + multi device + stability) should buy top of the line AC dual band devices offered by various brands like Asus AC 87U etc. But for now they are too too too costly. Just wait and watch the market for the price to drop (maybe a year). Until then this TP Link will faithfully serve you (hopefully). :)',\n",

I have to wait a lot of time for the router to respond to my commands on the web management interface when WiFi is on and there are devices connected to it.<br><br>And it is a bit quirky. One night my internet was not working and I thought of trying to restart the modem (not the router). Since the modem and the router are connected to the same power board, both the devices restarted when I flicked the switch off and then on. After that, even though the internet was back, the router dead refused to start its WiFi. I tried all sorts of things like restarting the router, restarting the WiFi; however no matter what I tried, the WiFi refused to spring back to life. I then connected it to my computer using a LAN cable and tried to tinker with the settings in the web management interface. Even the web interface was very slow to respond. I tried to default the settings - no response from the router. I tried to flash the firmware - no response from the router. I thought the router was dead for good. In my desperation to get it to work (God knows how I thought on doing this), I \"massaged\" the router. That is I pressed the body of the router from all sides thinking that might do something. And you know what, unbelievably it worked! The WiFi was back on and my devices could connect. It was like performing CPR on this thing! LOL!<br><br>Another quirk of this thing is that it sometimes decides by itself that it does not like some device and refuses dead to allow that particular device to connect although all other devices can connect fine. In such cases, I have to turn it off, let is rest for an hour (LOL!) and then bring it back up. Then is works fine for a few days until it again decides it does not like some device!',\n",

Signal drops significantly because of walls and obstructions.<br>3) Works well for speed upto 300 Mbps. Lets face it, we in India haven't seen speeds more that 50 Mbps.<br>4) Installation is pretty easy. You will be able to do it yourself.<br>5) Is not an ADSL router, so will work with service providers which give internet through LAN cable.<br><br>Does what it is supposed to do pretty well. Would have loved  to have better coverage. Overall great deal for the price. Can't really go wrong with purchase.<br><br>Another option to consider is a Dual band Router. A little expensive but might be help full for some people. Now lets get to the pros and cons of a Dual band router and let me try and explain to you how it works and in which case you should get one.<br><br>Lets start with the dual band thing. So you might be tempted to think a router has excellent range after all it has 3 antennas. 5dBi as the companies try and tell you should be very strong. But you will be disappointed with the results. The router has 2 antennas for the 2.4 GHz signal and one for the 5 GHz signal which will show as a different Wi-Fi signal.<br><br>Let me try and explain to you why you might need dual band signal.<br><br>You have signal broadcasted at different frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz in a dual band router. All the Wi-fi routers have signals broadcasted at 2.4 GHz and having too many routers in a small space makes it difficult to have a good connection and the signals from your router can interfere with signal from a nearby router. So if you are staying in a apartment with many Wi-Fi signals near you, having a the options to switch to 5GHz is a great one to have. But the coverage area for the 5 GHz signal is limited as only one antenna is dedicated for the 5 GHz signal.<br><br>One more thing many of us might now know is that the 2.4 GHz signal and the 5 GHz signal show us as separate Wi-Fi signals. So if you move away from the router you will have to switch from one Wi-Fi signal to the other.\",\n",

My neighbor has the same ISP and his connection was working fine. On a hunch i asked for a replacement and Amazon, as  superb as always, promptly arranged for a replacement. I got the second router on 17th Sept. Again, the first two days, it worked as expected, third day the same things started. frequent disconnection, super slow internet. I had to switch between my mobile data hotspot &amp; router multiple times in a day. WFH and having such a patchy network was super upsetting.  I called up the ISP to check if the network was all good and they sent a technician to my home to show me there was no issue in the network. He turned up with a DLink test router. Since i have been a long time customer, they allowed me to use the router for 2 weeks. not even one disconnection in the two weeks, good speed throughout. I ended up asking them to get me a new D-Link router, as even if it goes bust, they said will get it replaced.<br><br>Do not go for this. If you can, pay some more and go for a mid range router.

Re-connecting the TP-Link router led us back to the dropped-connections issue.  We re-connected the technician's router and surfed TP-Link forums for posts on this particular router, finding a number of posts from users facing exactly the same issue with all types of connections (not just static IP address) with all firmware versions starting from v6 to the current v10.

It can be connected via the RJ-45 Jack present on the back of the router having blue port. In terms of range it performs well according to my needs. I have a 3BHK and 2 storey house and router almost provides effective connection in almost all rooms and kitchen and on the rooms of 2nd floor effectively with as low as 1 bar(very far from the router) and with as high as 5 bars(near the router in my bedroom).I have a good internet connection and I almost connects two to four devices at a time and its bandwidth maintenance is good without any connection failure.<br>So in terms of performance of this router according to the price point I'll give it 5 Stars.<br>PROS are :<br>1)Two powerful antennas :Dual high gain antennas with 5 dBi capacity for better operation at around 100 meters away from the router.<br><br>2)Compact size  : not very bulky kinda look so place it anywhere but be sure to keep it in a open areas or to the place from where you can see most of your rooms in which you will gonna operate and also keep it in a above the ground.<br><br>3)Wifi toggle and WPS/Reset switch : If you wanna use the wifi of course you should turn the wifi on and if not then with a push of a button you can  turn it off.If due to some reason you don't like to mess with the wireless functions then with a push of WPS switch you can connect your wireless devices without accessing the router configuration screens, and without the wireless network security key/passphrase/password.<br>If you forgot your admin password,wireless pass and other security stuffs or you have end up messing with the router the you can prefer to push and hold the WPS/Reset switch for a while which will turn the router back to its original condition.<br><br>4)Led Indicators : 8 LED indicators constantly indicating you about the router activities with one power then wireless connectivity then 4 for 4 physical LAN ports and one for Internet activity and last for WPS.<br><br>5)UPTO 300Mbps : Router can handle internet speeds upto 300Mbps(37.5 MBps theoretically but actually supports more than 50MBps connection flawlessly).<br><br>6)New Features : New features are added in new v10.0 and v11.0 routers having WDS(which helps in making a bridge between two routers to extend the range in all around the house where network is weak) and Guest network ( creating a separate network to share datas with others safely) and Tp-link Tether to control the router wirelessly.<br><br>7)WPA2 encryption : to secure the wifi network from being hacked or misused by unwanted users.<br>AND more features you will find which I can't explain.....<br>So according to my opinion don't look around in search of best cuz best is here....GO FOR IT!!!<br>Cons : Nothing I've found till using it from about 10 days.<br>So don't loose this.Go for it!!<br>Thanks! have a nice day......\",\n",

       " 'WARNING: BUYERS BE AWARE!<br>Buyers need to be aware that the reviews that you are reading here are for different routers! There are actually SIX different models (as of 2015), in India, of this \"same\" router - TL-WR841N version 1, TL-WR841N version 7, TL-WR841N version 8, TL-WR841N version 9, TL-WR841N version 10 and TL-WR841N version 11.  And with each \"version\", TP-LINK has changed the hardware of this router. Naturally, with different hardware, the performance of the router varies a lot. Some of the reviews here are for \"version 8\" and below, while some are for \"version 9\" and above. That may explain the discrepancy in the reviews (for example, some have complained that the wifi coverage is \"average\", while others have said it is \"good\" or \"excellent\").<br><br>OpenWRT page on this router has a table comparing the hardware - [...]<br>PLEASE COMPLAIN TO AMAZON.COM ABOUT THIS and request them to ensure that seller also includes the \"version\" in the model number, and creates separate product page for each version so that the reviews are accurate and do not mislead us customers.<br><br>---<br><br>I bought another one of this router to extend my WiFi. Unfortunately, though the router supports WDS bridging it did not work.<br><br>That\\'s when I discovered that the two TL-WR841N routers I had purchased were not the same! (TP-Link themselves say that WDS bridging with different router models, from even the same company, may not work).  Last year (2014), when I had purchased this router I had got the \"version 9\" model and this year (2015) I received the \"version 10\" model.<br><br>It was irritating - to ensure that I could use both routers and extend my WiFi, I then had to install a beta version of DD-WRT on my older \"version 9\" model, and use my mediocre router hacking skills to make everything work.<br><br>----<br><br>(My first review of the older, \"version 9\" model is below  ...)<br><br>I had some concerns about buying a cheap modem from a Chinese company. But TP-Link seems to be a multi-national corporation and one of the top 10 players in this field. So I figured I\\'d take the risk.<br><br>Bought and received a factory sealed, brand new item from the seller. The parcel packaging was good and the item was undamaged and worked fine as soon it was plugged in. The month and year of import was listed as \"July 2014\" for the item I received. For those who want to install DD-WRT please note that I received a \"Version 9\" model of this router, and not \"Version: 8\" as listed in the Amazon.com description for this router\\'s page. Since I didn\\'t wish to void the warranty by installing custom firmware anyway, it didn\\'t matter to me (the TL-WR841N comes with a 3 years replacement warranty, which is great considering its price).<br><br>The stock firmware offers a good enough set of options and is easily accessible through a web based interface you can use with any modern browser. The range is decent, but nothing extraordinary. My previous Linksys ADSL modem had a weak signal and thus occasionally dropped connections in the first floor. The signal on the first floor above is still weak, but the wifi connections seem more stable  with this modem.<br><br>Overall, happy so far. Will update this feedback, with additional information on this routers performance, after a few months.<br><br>Update 1:<br>It\\'s been 9+ months on now since I purchased this router. Since the purchase, TP - Link has released 2-3 firmware updates, and I was safely able to upgrade the router without any issues each time. Performance of the router remains satisfactory. Using it both through wifi and LAN cable, and network connection is stable and good on both. Sometimes it is on for days but it doesn\\'t heat up much at all.<br><br>Update 2 (Jul 2016):<br>I have added another star based on the following experience - On my recommendation, my friends bought this router too. Strangely, 3 of the 5 routers conked out within 6 months. I reminded them about TP-Links warranty. But 2 of them didn\\'t bother and purchased another router (different brand). The other person contacted TP-Link and told them about this issue. They asked him to ship it to their service centre, which he did. After a week or so, he received a replacement which had a sticker stating \"Certified Refurbished\" on the box of the router. It worked perfectly. It\\'s good to know that TP-Link honours their warranty.<br><br>CORRECTION<br>I had earlier mentioned that I faced network connections issues while torrenting, and suspected it could be because the TP-Link router couldn\\'t handle the number of connections that torrenting sometimes require. But it was an issue due to my ISP.',\n",

       " \"I need to clear a few misconceptions about the WR940N router.<br>* Even though the 802.11n technology supports dual band technology, this router does not come with it, so will not support 5GHz band. If you live in an area where there are multiple WiFi networks in the vicinity, there are chances that your effective range you could get with this router will be less due to the cluttered 2.4GHz frequency signal. In that case, this router may not be as effective for you.<br>* The advertised speed of 450Mbps is not the highest theoretical speed of internet, but rather among the devices connected wirelessly in the same network. Example, you can access LAN media servers connected on the same WiFi network for a maximum of 450Mbps.<br>* That being said, each antenna is capable of 150Mbps bandwidth and the router can support a maximum of 3x3 networking (which means 3 parallel streams of 150Mbps bandwidth to-fro the 3 antennas) which effectively is capable of 450Mbps. Remember that your phone/laptop must be rated for 3x3 MIMO to fully use this bandwidth. If it's rated for 2x2, then it's max bandwidth with this router will be 300Mbps.<br>* The fastest internet you can achieve wirelessly using this router is only 100Mbps, because the Input Ethernet port (WAN port) of this router is only capable of 100Mbps bandwidth. Also, each of the 4 output Ethernet ports are also rated for 100Mbps. So, if you're planning to upgrade sometime in the future to over 100Mbps, then this router is not for you.<br>* Unlike some cheap D-Link routers, it's good that this router supports PPPoE authentication that many Indian ISPs are using.<br>* Output ethernet ports 1 to 4 act as a bridge between each other and can access each other's shared network, so you can also set up your LAN accordingly.\",\n",

Thanks to Amazon for the great packaging and fast delivery as promised ! This product is absolutely genuine.<br><br>The product contains the Router,Lan cable,power cable and manuals.<br><br>First of all, I would like to clear the confusion between people which i have witnessed in the reviews about this product.This router is supported for all the local service providers like Youtelecom,Hathaway and many more. This router doesn't support Airtel and BSNL as they require ADSL modems.This doesn't have any USB ports or anything,it is just a simple wireless router.The antennas cannot be detached for this router.Though the router doesn't look that attractive, but the performance is all that matters right ? This device performs much beyond than it should, and i am not exaggerating. According to my 4 months of usage, this performs like a charm.I use it for nearly 14-16 hours a day and there is no heating problem.The range of this router is absolutely amazing with no signal drops.It can easily cover 2-3 BHK apartment easily. I could even use internet 2 floors above and below my flat. This is what surprised me ! I have connected 4-5 devices over wifi but i don't have any idea what is the limit.This router has advanced security system like other routers to prevent unauthorized access. Installation procedure is very easy and you can do it manually by just reading the manuals provided.<br><br>One more thing i would to like to tell you is that you can't access internet directly by just simply connecting the router from your modem.You need to call your local service provider to inform that you have purchased a new router and tell them to update the MAC number (below the router) in their system,then only you can access the internet.<br><br>In my opinion, this is the best product out there in the market at most reasonable price.You won't find router with double antenna of other brands below Rs.1000.Without any second thought in your mind, just for this router !

Let me add some points:<br><br>Background:<br>I was using a rock-solid performer Linksys WRT 54 G for almost a decade and it continues to prove its worth. I was using Airtel broadband 2 mbps plan. I recently moved to ACT fibernet with comparable internet speeds of 42 mbps average (both download and upload). Apparently, my Linksys WRT 54 G could not deliver this speed. It could do a max of 14 mbps :( ... you know its G band after all. In practical terms, G routers can do 15 Mbps vs theoretical 54 Mbps.<br><br>I wanted to move to N band router (theoretical 300 Mbps) and wanted to touch the waters and I landed up with TP Link WR841N 300Mbps. Following is my feedback:<br><br>First Impression Out of the Box:<br>Poor plastic grade. However, the fit and finish was adorable despite the poor plastic appearance &amp; feel.<br><br>Speed - Did I get my anticipated wireless 42 Mbps speed based on my ACT fiber provider?<br>Answer: Yes &amp; No<br>2 Feet - Full speed 42 Mbps internet. -- Signal Bar: Full 5<br>5 Feet - 37 Mbps – 5 Bar<br>10 Feet - 20 Mbps – 5 Bar<br>15 Feet - 15 Mbps – 5 Bar<br>20 Feet - 10 Mbps – 4 or 5 Bar<br>25 Feet - 5 Mbps – 3 or 4 Bar<br>30 Feet – 3 to 5 Mbps – Almost Dead<br><br>No walls in between. Tested under line of sight conditions. Tested on free channels with various settings.<br><br>In a way, this device is like a wife like material. You need to be close enough to get all the attention and at all times (Just kidding, no offence meant).<br><br>I flashed the DD WRT firmware (with careful instructions) and I played around with all combinations to optimize the experience and there had been no significant change. This means, the hardware has already done its best. We cannot ask a Tiger to run like a Cheetah, can we? :)<br><br>One important factor: There was not a single dropout or restart and it’s a stable device (tested for a week).<br><br>Value for Money? In my opinion, I think this device has performed for what I have paid for. Can’t expect more.<br><br>What Next? For folks who want solid performance (range + speed + multi device + stability) should buy top of the line AC dual band devices offered by various brands like Asus AC 87U etc. But for now they are too too too costly. Just wait and watch the market for the price to drop (maybe a year). Until then this TP Link will faithfully serve you (hopefully). :)',\n",

       " 'Got it very cheap for less than a thousand quid. Since this router has two antennae, I was expecting stellar performance and range from it. However the range is not that great, and it has a hard time performing when multiple devices are connected to it. The signal strength does not continually remain strong even in the room in which the router is kept. Beyond one brick wall, the signal strength drops considerably. Beyond two brick walls, there is no range at all. Beyond one brick wall, the range (from the router) is at the most 8-10 meters. There is no range whatsoever on the floor above or below the floor on which the router is kept. The router software has a lot of options to set it up the way you like. It is possible to create a considerably secure WiFi network using the given options. However, when the WiFi is on, the router is very slow to respond on the web interface. I have to wait a lot of time for the router to respond to my commands on the web management interface when WiFi is on and there are devices connected to it.<br><br>And it is a bit quirky. One night my internet was not working and I thought of trying to restart the modem (not the router). Since the modem and the router are connected to the same power board, both the devices restarted when I flicked the switch off and then on. After that, even though the internet was back, the router dead refused to start its WiFi. I tried all sorts of things like restarting the router, restarting the WiFi; however no matter what I tried, the WiFi refused to spring back to life. I then connected it to my computer using a LAN cable and tried to tinker with the settings in the web management interface. Even the web interface was very slow to respond. I tried to default the settings - no response from the router. I tried to flash the firmware - no response from the router. I thought the router was dead for good. In my desperation to get it to work (God knows how I thought on doing this), I \"massaged\" the router. That is I pressed the body of the router from all sides thinking that might do something. And you know what, unbelievably it worked! The WiFi was back on and my devices could connect. It was like performing CPR on this thing! LOL!<br><br>Another quirk of this thing is that it sometimes decides by itself that it does not like some device and refuses dead to allow that particular device to connect although all other devices can connect fine. In such cases, I have to turn it off, let is rest for an hour (LOL!) and then bring it back up. Then is works fine for a few days until it again decides it does not like some device!',\n",

Lets face it, we in India haven't seen speeds more that 50 Mbps.<br>4) Installation is pretty easy.

Would have loved  to have better coverage. Overall great deal for the price. Can't really go wrong with purchase.<br><br>Another option to consider is a Dual band Router. A little expensive but might be help full for some people. Now lets get to the pros and cons of a Dual band router and let me try and explain to you how it works and in which case you should get one.<br><br>Lets start with the dual band thing. So you might be tempted to think a router has excellent range after all it has 3 antennas. 5dBi as the companies try and tell you should be very strong. But you will be disappointed with the results. The router has 2 antennas for the 2.4 GHz signal and one for the 5 GHz signal which will show as a different Wi-Fi signal.<br><br>Let me try and explain to you why you might need dual band signal.<br><br>You have signal broadcasted at different frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz in a dual band router. All the Wi-fi routers have signals broadcasted at 2.4 GHz and having too many routers in a small space makes it difficult to have a good connection and the signals from your router can interfere with signal from a nearby router. So if you are staying in a apartment with many Wi-Fi signals near you, having a the options to switch to 5GHz is a great one to have. But the coverage area for the 5 GHz signal is limited as only one antenna is dedicated for the 5 GHz signal.<br><br>One more thing many of us might now know is that the 2.4 GHz signal and the 5 GHz signal show us as separate Wi-Fi signals. So if you move away from the router you will have to switch from one Wi-Fi signal to the other.\",\n",

I had to switch between my mobile data hotspot &amp; router multiple times in a day. WFH and having such a patchy network was super upsetting.  I called up the ISP to check if the network was all good and they sent a technician to my home to show me there was no issue in the network. He turned up with a DLink test router. Since i have been a long time customer, they allowed me to use the router for 2 weeks. not even one disconnection in the two weeks, good speed throughout.

I made the mistake of not reading through the TP-Link forums for this particular product and ended up wasting some time.<br><br>My Internet connection has a static IP address assigned by my ISP.  I had been using a Belkin router on this connection for the past 5 years, which went bust for some reason a few weeks back.  I ordered this TP-Link router as a replacement.  After adding the connection settings to the router, it connected to the ISP's server within the first 30 seconds.  The connection was smooth initially but after about 2 minutes, the connectivity simply dropped.  I could not resolve any domain name or even ping my ISP's server.<br><br>After a lot of trial and error I rebooted the router and the connectivity was restored.  The connection remained stable for another 30 seconds and then disappeared again.  Several reboots later I observed that the connection remained stable for a maximum of 5 minutes at a time.  I called up my ISP and asked them to bring their own router along.  The ISP's technician came, configured his own router and the connection worked fine for 30 minutes.  Re-connecting the TP-Link router led us back to the dropped-connections issue.  We re-connected the technician's router and surfed TP-Link forums for posts on this particular router, finding a number of posts from users facing exactly the same issue with all types of connections (not just static IP address) with all firmware versions starting from v6 to the current v10.  No one had been able to resolve the problem other than by installing a custom firmware.<br><br>Disappointed, I returned the item.  Credit to Amazon for taking the return without asking any questions.  The charged amount was also refunded to me within a week's time.<br><br>Overall, a very unreliable device and no resolution if one happens to get stuck with a bad piece.\",\n",

My previous TP Link ADSL2+ with 2 antennas had much better range than this one. But, the bigger problem is it becoming unresponsive every now and then. Pinging it either takes almost half a second or gets timed out. When it becomes unresponsive, I need to restart it. Sometimes restarting helps, sometimes not. Its not that it becomes unresponsive after running a long time. Actually, I keep it running for less than few hours at most.

       " 'Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.<br><br>Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn\\'t pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to \"Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos\". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.<br><br>When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn\\'t work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don\\'t always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 \"monster of a chipset\", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn\\'t order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.<br><br>When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don\\'t have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.<br><br>When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.<br><br>There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren\\'t on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).<br><br>Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it\\'s better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones.

The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.<br><br>Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.<br><br>Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.<br><br>Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.<br><br>Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.<br><br>Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.<br><br>Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.\",\n",

Nord CE 2 lite seems the perfect option given that it was coming from brand one plus. It won't be fair to compare my 5T with this given the price range. But let me list few things which one plus completely degraded<br>1. The camera quality - worse. 64MP is just on paper. The photos pixalates even when taken in bright sunlight. Highly downgraded from one plus standards.<br>2. Fingerprint sensors - they merged the fingerprint sensor with the power button. It has definately complicated the whole functionality. Firstly there's less space to read fingerprints, which leads to unresponsive sensors. And secondly it messes up big time. Lot of confusion while pressing the power button - whether it'll unlock or just woke up tye screen. Most of the time my phone is vibrating on accidentally touching the button.<br>3. Processor - One plus is aggresive in cost cutting. Shifted even the flagship phones to mediatek. Thankfully this one still comes with Snapdragon, but a 6 series one. Does the job, but is not as smooth as you expect from one plus.<br>4. Overall it feels like a oppo, vivo phone more than a one plus phone. Just a mid series average phone commanding a higer price tag just for the brand one plus.\",\n",

       " 'Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:<br><br>Pros:<br>- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed<br>- Smooth performance and display<br>- Comparatively compact and light weight<br>- \"Unofficial\" water resistance (read below)<br>- Design and color is neat<br><br>Cons:<br>- Speaker isn\\'t great<br>- Camera is okayish<br>- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of now<br><br>Detailed:<br>- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.<br>- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.<br>- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can\\'t be uninstalled). Didn\\'t find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo\\'s ColorOS.<br>- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven\\'t noticed any heating afterwards.<br>- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be \"unofficial\" water resistance.<br>- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven\\'t tested much low light or night photography.<br>- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).<br><br>Overall it\\'s a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.',\n",

Performance is superb, didn\\'t feel any lag or bug yet.<br>( ***Edition: YouTube unexpectedly closing 2-3 times repeatedly in 1 day , that may be bug which I faced recently)<br>2. OS &amp; Software: Got 2 security updates &amp; 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)<br>3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.<br>4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)<br>5. Gaming Performance: don\\'t play any games so look some other\\'s review.<br>6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.<br>7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.<br>8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.<br>9. You can definitely enjoy 4K YouTube Videos (As HDR 10 Certified).<br>10. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brands neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.<br>(***Edition: You can turn off that features for screenshot in setting)<br>2. Camera should be improved in low light.<br>3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.<br>4. You can\\'t record any call otherwise it will inform the person that you are recording the voice.<br><br>Pro Tips: 1. Use \"Ultra Steady Mode\" to take video for your content/personal memory.<br>2. Select \\'Standard Refresh Rate\\' for better battery output.<br><br>I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage.',\n",

Display<br>The display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.<br>2. Processor &amp; Ram<br>I have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.<br>3. Battery<br>Your phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.<br>4. Camera<br>I don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.<br>The front camera is quite good.<br>5. Design &amp; Body<br>There is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.<br>6. Operating System<br>Loved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.<br><br>Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.\",\n",

The basic set up was ok but anything beyond that was confusing.<br><br>I was finding myself only looking at the watch for the time since everything else seem to be giving so many issues and the inaccuracy was too much. Paying 22k to look at the time was ridiculous in my personal opinion.<br>Don't splurge and go for the many other cheaper options that are available in the market today.

Wer denkt \"Gebrauchsanweisungen sind für Verlierer!\"... Viel Glück. Das kann dauern.<br><br>Wenn man sich jedoch schön gewissenhaft an die Schritt-für-Schritt Anleitung hält, kann nichts schief gehen. Okay - man sollte das Passwort für sein heimisches Wlan parat haben. Und das für sein Spotify Konto, wenn man Spotify auf der Uhr nutzen möchte.

Alles problemlos.<br><br>Weil ich gerade bei Alexa bin... Ich habe mehrere Male versucht, die Beleuchtung in meiner Wohnung (Hue Birnen) und Wlan Steckdosen von unterwegs aus zu schalten.

Januar 2020 - von 5 auf 2 Sterne reduziert.<br><br>Die Uhr war wirklich klasse. Bis gestern. Denn es geht nichts mehr. Zumindest mit der App. Der App, die unbedingt nötig ist, um die Uhr funktionieren zu lassen. Und dazu der armseligste Support aller Zeiten. Der Reihe nach...<br><br>Es ging damit los, dass sich die Wlan Einstellungen in der App nicht mehr öffnen liessen. Ich dachte zuerst an einen Fehler, den man durch Neustart beheben könnte. Neustart der App und auch Neustart des Handys. Keine Veränderung. Jetzt wird\\'s aber erst richtig interessant! Ich bekam über die App eine Email, in der mir gesagt wurde, dass der Akku Ladestand niedrig sei und ich die Uhr laden solle. Kein Problem - der Akku hält sehr lange. Uhr geladen, alles bestens.<br><br>Nur liess sich die Uhr ab jetzt nicht mehr mit der App synchronisieren. Ich hatte den FitBit Support angeschrieben. Dort wurde ich auf die Hilfe Seiten verwiesen. Okay. Uhr ausschalten, wieder einschalten. Bluetooth Verbindung trennen und wieder verbinden. App deinstallieren, Uhr ausschalten, App neu installieren, Uhr einschalten u.s.w.  Resultat: Nichts. Nur eine Fehlermeldung, dass die Synchronisierung nicht erfolgen kann. Warum? Das wird leider nicht gesagt. Dann die Lösung aller Probleme: Die Uhr vom FitBit Konto abmelden, die App deinstallieren, App wieder laden, installieren und dann die Uhr wieder anmelden. Klingt nachvollziehbar. Aber jetzt... Die App geöffnet, in meinem Benutzerkonto angemeldet - alles in Ordnung. Jetzt die Taste \" +Neues Gerät anmelden\" gedrückt. Dann kommt eine Auswahl, in der man das Modell anwählen soll, das man eben anmelden möchte. In meinem Fall Versa 2. Dann gelangt man auf ein blaues Feld, in dem unten steht: Einrichten. Da drauf geklickt und - das war\\'s. Sackgasse. Nur noch eine Fehlermeldung (siehe Bild). Und damit endet der Versuch, die Uhr in der zugehörigen App anzumelden. Keine Synchronisation mehr, keine Wlan Einstellungen, kein gar nichts.<br><br>Und zum Schluß die Kirsche auf der Sahne... Der Support von FitBit teilte mir mit, dass das Problem wohl bekannt sei - dass das schon einigen Nutzern so ergangen sei, aber dass man im Moment leider nicht helfen könne. Und man hat sich im Voraus sehr freundlich für meine Geduld bedankt. Ich habe jetzt also eine Uhr, die perfekt funktioniert hat, bis die App von einen auf den anderen Tag einen Bug produziert der alles (!) stoppt und der Support mir höflich erklärt, dass man da wohl nichts machen kann.<br><br>Ich habe also über 180.- Euro für eine Uhr bezahlt, die wegen eines bekannten (!) Softwareproblems einfach nicht mehr benutzbar ist. Die Foren, die sich mit Smartwatches befassen, haben beängstigend viele Einträge von Usern, die ebenfalls Probleme mit der Software haben. Wenn die Uhr mit der App funktioniert, ist sie erstklassig. Aber wenn die Software so voller Bugs und Fehlern ist, dass die Uhr plötzlich nur noch eine nette Dekoration am Handgelenk wird, ist das nicht gut. Und auch nicht fair gegenüber den Kunden, denen hier offensichtlich übereilt etwas angeboten wurde, das noch nicht durchentwickelt war. Die Uhr geht zurück, vielen Dank...',\n",

       " 'So I purchased the Versa 2 as a step up from the Fitbit Inspire 2, which was a nifty tool for the basics of fitness but it was definitely lacking in features. I debated between the Versa 2 and Versa 3, opting for the Versa 2 because I\\'m not the most active of people, so the features the 3 had weren\\'t super important for me.<br><br>Out of the box, the Versa 2 definitely looks snazzy. It\\'s got a sleek look to it, and the watchface is much easier to read in direct sunlight compared to the Inspire 2. It even comes with a second strap that\\'s bigger for those with larger wrists. Removing the existing strap is easy, but getting it back in was a bit of a struggle. The watch also comes with a charger that clamps around the watch, which is much better than the Inspire 2\\'s. The only problem is that the cable comes out of the bottom of the clamp, so the clamp can\\'t lie flat on a surface which is a little bizzare.<br><br>Unfortunately, the problems with the watch kick in about as soon as you turn it on. Disclaimer: I work with tech for a living, and this put me through the ringer. The watch will need an update as soon as it boots up (which is to be expected). However, the watch has such a hard time connecting to Wifi. There\\'s the option to instead install the update through your phone\\'s Bluetooth, but after multiple attempts this just wouldn\\'t work. Eventually I just had to keep resetting the watch until eventually it recognised my Wifi.<br><br>Once the watch was all set up, I wasn\\'t a big fan of the default \"watchface\" it gives you. Luckily, you can download up to five watchfaces from the app on your phone, and you can switch through them on the fly. There\\'s a surprisingly vast amount of free ones that look genuinely good. Some of them even allow for a hefty amount of customisation of colours and what you want to display. If you want more in-depth features for the watchface you can also buy paid ones as well, but I haven\\'t felt like they\\'re holding these features for paid watchfaces only.<br><br>However, after downloading a particular watchface, suddenly all of my metrics (Steps taken, Calories burnt, things like that) went to zero.  This was literally about an hour after booting up the watch. Thinking that switching to another watchface and back would fix it, it turns out that watchface was now stuck. And in a strange tech oversight, you can\\'t delete a watchface you\\'ve set as your current watchface. Looking for support online, it turns out that the best way to resolve what appears to be a common issue is to Factory Reset the watch. Which meant going through the entire Wifi connection process again.<br><br>All in all, it\\'s a really disappointing watch. Obviously the bugs are a pain, but it\\'s moreso that if they were ironed out, it\\'d be a really good tracker watch. I\\'m not going to bother returning it since it does the job for me, but if you\\'re expecting a polished piece of tech, this ain\\'t it. The fact there\\'s a Versa 3 already out means that support for the Versa 2 is likely already on the way out. So I\\'d recommend looking elsewhere unless you\\'re ready to wrestle with some problems that seem like they should\\'ve been sorted ages ago.',\n",
       " 'This review is split into two parts: one for the tracker itself and one for the app and company. My overall rating for this product is 2.5 Stars.<br><br>Versa 2: 3.5 Stars<br><br>I had my Versa 2 for a year and a half before it had a quick downward spiral from the touchscreen acting up a bit to completely nonfunctional within two weeks. While I am not impressed with the longevity, I found the watch to be useful and handy but also lacking for the cost. For context, I paid around $150 on a sale, and not long after I believe it went on sale for $130, but even judging by the $150 price and not the full price, it is disappointing.<br><br>Pros<br>-Tracking: For others, this may be a Con since I cannot verify how precise the tracking is, but as someone who uses it more casually, I found it to be perfectly fine. It did a reasonable job at tracking my steps, logging my exercises, and telling me how I slept.<br>-Apps: Aside from the default apps, additional apps can be installed. You can rearrange the apps too to put the useful apps in easier access. Generally, I found it easier to use apps on my phone but some like the alarms and timers are great.<br>-Customization: One big positive for the Versa 2 is that it is fairly customizable. It can change its clockface from a huge selection and easily swap between them. You can also swap out the watch bands.<br><br>Cons<br>-Alexa Support: This is an awesome feature in concept, but the majority of the time it failed to work. At least 4/5 times when I tried to use it, it would tell me it couldn\\'t connect and to set it up in the app (it was already set up). It was so inconsistent that I stopped using it over more reliable means.<br>-Bands: As nice it is to be able to change the bands, it is annoying to swap them. Other trackers like the Charge 4 can swap bands far more easily.<br>-Interfaces: This is a more minor nitpick, but something about the look of the apps reminded me of a decade-old device rather than something modern.<br>-Longevity: If you told me when I bought this that it would only last 1.5 years before breaking (averaging $8+ a month), I probably would have gotten something else instead. If you are used to upgrading devices often, this may not be a big deal but as someone who wanted a device for the next 3-5 years, this majorly underperformed.<br><br>Fitbit: 1.5 Stars<br><br>The App<br>In terms of content, the app is pretty nice. It displays the information from the tracker nicely and it lets you input additional data to track weight, food, water, and exercises. However, it has one glaring problem: connectivity. The trackers need the app to sync the data and from my experience, it likes to not do this for seemingly no reason. If you search \"Fitbit won\\'t sync\" or look at the app reviews, you\\'ll probably find I am not alone in this issue. Sometimes the troubleshooting like restarting Bluetooth or my phone will help but other times I can try every trick and it still won\\'t manage to sync, then a day or two later it will start working again. At times it is so bad that I\\'d get my weekly report email and half the week with have nothing because it went that long without syncing. Other trackers may run into similar issues, but I don\\'t recall it being nearly this bad with my old Fitbit One, which synced with an adapted on the desktop, so since new trackers only work with the app that seems to be at least part of the problem.<br><br>The Company<br>Before the Versa 2, I had a Fitbit One that I used so much I needed my third replacement strap. To the best of my knowledge, that Fitbit One still works fine as ever. When the Blaze transition to Versa, I noticed far more negative reviews pointing out issues. I hoped the next model would be better, but the same problems seemed to persist or even gotten worse. And based on my own experiences, these new trackers do feel subpar and not as good as they used to be.<br><br>After my Versa 2 broke, just after the year warranty, support did offer me a 30% discount on a new tracker through their website. Unfortunately, this didn\\'t count for much as they\\'d run a sale within the week offering around 20% off. I ended up getting a Charge 4 and the tracker is pretty good, especially for what I paid, but the company stooped to a new low by dropped support for my device right after I ordered and failing to notify me, then giving me terrible support to the point it was insulting and refusing to accept any returns or offer any compensation for effectively delivering a product different to the one I ordered.<br><br>Overall, I would not recommend a Fitbit. Personally, I am looking into other trackers/smartwatches, specifically Garmin. But if you want to try a Fitbit, I\\'d suggest a Charge or similar model over a Versa. Also, I\\'d look out for a sale, which tends to happen multi times a year.',\n",
       " 'Der Versand und die Abwicklung durch Amazon lief super.<br><br>Der Support von Fitbit ist zwar gut auch wenn man bei kaputtem Touchdisplay die Anweisung bekommt \"auf dem Gerät die Einstellungen anzuwählen\", was natürlich nicht funktioniert, wenn das Display nicht mehr reagiert. Nun aber zur endlosen Geschichte meines mitlerweile Fitneßuhrtraumas: Bei der Versa 2 hat irgendwann angefangen das Display wie wild hin und herzuscrollen und reagierte nicht mehr. Als Ersatz wurden mir nach Ausschöpfung aller Behebungsmöglichkeiten, wie bei der Versa 1, das Angebot: Rabatt auf die Sense oder kostenloser Ersatz einer Versa 2, angeboten. Nun habe ich die Sense seit Dezember 21 und auch diese hat gestern beim Spazierengehen unvermittelt den Geist aufgegeben. Das Display ließ sich nicht mehr bedienen und reagierte nicht mehr auf Berührungen. Zudem schaltete sie sich etliche Male aus. Blöd, wenn Messungen die erfordern, dass man die Uhr 14 Tage trägt nun wieder dahin sind und man den 2. Wanderurlaub ohne funktionierende Uhr verbringen muss.😒 Ich trage die Uhr nie zum Duschen, mit Schutzfolie auf dem Display und reinige sie täglich mit einem weichen Tuch, weil ich wollte, dass die Uhr möglichst lange hält. Dennoch geht es mir jetzt nach 3 Uhren in 3 Jahren langsam auf den Zeiger, dass man jedes Mal das Prozedere mit dem Support durchführen muss und Fitbit es nicht hinbekommt, eine Uhr herzustellen, die auch langfristig hält. Ich möchte mal wissen, was ist, wenn man wirklich mal Sportarten damit macht, wo man noch stark schwitzt oder schwimmt...ich wandere und mache Yoga, wo die Uhr nun wirklich nicht beansprucht wird. Bin auch absolut kein Fan davon negative Bewertungen zu verfassen aber bei der Uhr bin ich langsam wirklich an der Grenze angekommen und ärgere mich, dass ich erneut wieder 2 Tage mit dem Support rumhampel. Man hat ja auch sonst nichts zu tun. Die Sense war jetzt nochmal eine Ecke teurer (249 Euro) und macht ebenso faxen trotz höchster Pflege, obwohl man von einer Fitnessuhr in dieser Preisklasse ein Minimum an Belastbarkeit erwarten kann. Jedes Jahr eine neue Uhr rauszuschicken ist jedenfalls keine gute Geschäftsstrategie, es sei denn die Produktionskosten und billige Technik erlauben so ein Vorgehen. In gängigen Fitbitforen habe ich auch mittlerweile gesehen, dass etliche Kunden ähnliche Probleme haben...eigentlich schade, da die Funktionen, Messungen, Programme und Statistiken der Uhr und App mir total zugesagt haben und bei den Trainings lediglich Ashtanga Yoga wählbar ist und daher die Aufzeichnung für Vinyasa oder Hatha-Yoga nicht sehr präzise ist. Es bringt leider viel Frust, wenn man immer wieder bei 0 anfängt und die neue Uhr wieder 14 Tage tragen muss, um Werte über den Schlaf zu erhalten, dies dann wieder unterbrochen wird, weil die Uhr erneut kaputt ist, die sense sogar nach 8 Monaten...ich wünsche mir solidere und langlebigere Technik/Konstruktion und endlich eine dauerhafte Lösung für diese Schwierigkeiten. Bis dahin rate ich, trotz Abstrichen in der App und bei den Messungen für Modelle der Konkurrenz, die solider gebaut sind. Bei einer Freundin hat sich auch sichtbar das Dichtungsgummi im hinteren Bereich gelöst und stand heraus. Sehr schmal und wohl durch die Körperwärme herausgelöst. Bei ihr ist die Fitbit kurz danach auch in den Streik gegangen und schaltete sich komplett ab...sowas ist schade und sollte auch bei Tests von Fitneßuhren, die man sich vor Kauf vom solchen Uhren durchliest, berücksichtigt werden. Ich hoffe sehr, dass Fitbit dort nochmal irgendwann korrigiert.<br><br>Einen Stern für die schnelle Lieferung Amazon, einen Stern für die App/den Support. Ansonsten kann ich leider nur zum Kauf abraten. Für die Qualität der Uhren: Versa, Versa 2 und Sense 0 Sterne.',\n",

I proceed to try to put it back in and when I did so, the watch face turned white, with streaks of color.  I actually contacted customer service to see if I could get a possible discount for another watch even though I was outside of the warranty by about a month. I knew the chances were slim that I would get any satisfaction, but you can't blame me for trying as this was a $160 purchase that only lasted a little over a year.

With the name Fitbit being one of the most well-known and will established smartwatch manufacturers I expected they would have their act together.<br><br>1. The interface / getting around the software on this watch is clunky at best awkward and disorganized.  Just trying to find the most basic of features on a smartwatch... . The sleep module is ridiculously hard to do. It's easy to find heart rate monitor calorie burning and step counting but try to find the icon for the sleep feature... Go ahead try!!<br><br>The $30 smartwatch I purchased previous to this that looked identicle in shape and size I was easily able to find an spo2 feature. On this watch the feature does not appear as a separate module and when I try to download a watch face that displays spo2 it says it's unavailable for this model.<br><br>Bluetooth: I have never had a smart device disconnect from Bluetooth as often as this one does.  It seems like every 10 minutes it's asking me if I want to pair the device.  in 2022 this is unacceptable. When I  search for solutions none of them seem to fix this consistently.<br><br>Sleep monitoring.  My Galaxy watch monitors my sleep automatically and is relatively accurate.  The first night I had this watch on my wrist I woke up in the middle of the night took a look and not one ounce of sleep was monitored..... Since I can't even find a sleep module on the watch I look to my smartphone in the app and shows zero sleep tracking activity monitored. Maybe because the Bluetooth can't seem to get attacked together between the watch and the app?<br><br>Doing good thing I had to say about this watch is that it was very accurate when I monitored my activity on my treadmill and my weight lifting and it is nice that it has food module you can log the food you eat.<br><br>My wife who has sleep apnea is especially disappointed in this device not being able to monitor her sleep.  If I can't get this resolved I'm going to have to return both watches hers and mine.  They been manufacturing smart watches I think longer than anyone else..... You think after all this time they could have their act together?\",\n",
       " 'Before my fit bit broke unexpectedly- I would have given it 3 stars as a fairly reliable, basic but good step counter and sleep tracker. It was never good at picking up activity such as cycling- which I do everyday. But I’ve dropped to 2 stars as after a year of use, today the face of the watch just fell off. It appears the glue holding it in place disintegrated. Then it fully stopped working (I was going to try and have it repaired but I honestly don’t think it’s worth it). I paid £147 for this and it’s just honestly not worth it. It’s worth at most £50 and even then you might only get a years use out of it before it craps out on you! Lovely design and comfortable to wear but poorly made and very basic functioning. I don’t recommend. Ps. Do not swim with this thing on if you want it to last!',\n",

Other than its failure in the water, I really love the alarm feature as it doesn\\'t wake up anyone other than me.  The distance tracker is quite accurate and being able to configure the \\'watch face\\' is fabulous as I can configure the time to be large so I can read it without glasses during the night.  I view the sleep analysis every day and it correlates with my own estimation of how well I slept.  There are many other features (e.g., reading texts on the screen, etc) which I haven\\'t used so I won\\'t comment on those. So, FITBIT, either make your device truly water-resistant ...

       " \"I was so excited to receive my Versa 2! It was very easy to set up even for someone like me who's not tech savvy at all.  My husband was also pretty impressed so ordered one for himself the day mine arrived as there was a good deal on Prime Day.<br>Unfortunately it didn't take long for my excitement to turn to disappointment.<br>Why? Firstly, as an insomniac I was interested to see just how messy my sleep was only to find that I apparently have a pretty good night's sleep. It registers as sleep for as long as I'm in the horizontal position even when I'm fidgeting. On some occasions it's actually registered me as asleep when I'm sat up in bed reading!<br>Secondly, step counting.  It's not just leg movements it counts but often arm movements too. For example, washing and drying my hands measures 40-50 steps.  I contacted Fitbit support about this and we went through a whole factory reset but this changed nothing.  When I told them this, they just lost interest and suggested that I'd just have to deal with it.  I reckon that about 15-30% of my steps are actually arm movements. I do wear it on my non-dominant arm.<br>Thirdly, syncing.  My watch and app on my phone don't automatically sync when bluetooth is turned on.  I have to do it manually and then restart my phone to activate the sync ....... every single time.<br>Also, when using the Exercise mode (I use treadmill and weights when at the gym) the watch randomly vibrates.  It doesn't seem to relate to anything in particular and on the one occasion I counted how many times it happened, it amounted to 16 times in 20 minutes.  It really is distracting.<br>My husband's watch has exactly the same issues so it seems like these are common to the Versa 2.<br>It isn't actually very comfortable to wear either especially in warm weather as the plastic strap causes sweating.<br>On a positive note, the one thing is does do very accurately is tell the time!\",\n",
       " 'After about a month of use all I can really say about it is \"meh\".<br><br>Cons<br> - (if you workout a lot) I found wearing this for so many active hours a week caused sores on my wrist. The material of the strap will do a number on your skin. I rotate wrists, right now the sores on the left wrist are recovering while the strap destroys my right wrist.<br> - Heart rate monitor isn\\'t reliable. I\\'ve had it strapped really tightly to my wrist, yet if I\\'m getting very active the heartrate screen blinks out as if there is no contact with my wrist. I have a medical grade heart rate monitor, I compared it to that one in real time. The Fitbit is off, usually by 5-7~.<br> - The shortcut key is very annoying. Frequently when doing sphinx pushups or just pushups in general the key is depressed by my wrist. Alexa or whatever else pops up. Might as well set the shortcut key to nothing.<br> - I turned on the \\'Lock device if it leaves your wrist\" security feature. Even though its strapped tightly, I have to enter the code about every other 10 minutes.<br> - The workout menu is full of activities I do not give a single shit about. I cannot remove them or add activities I  DO CARE about.<br> - Spotify link to your phone is horrible, not sure why I\\'d ever want to use it. Half the time it says it cant find your phone, even though you repeatedly sync it. Spent more time trying to make it work than I actually functionally used it.<br> - Quality of audio output to a speaker or blue tooth headphones is absolutely horrible.<br> - The cardio fitness score makes zero sense. It started really high for me, then by the end of the month its telling me POOR to FAIR 31-35, \"Poor fitness for men your age\". I do at least 15 hours of cardio a week on a bad week, and a full lifting schedule. So I assume the rating is completely meaningless.<br><br>Pros<br> - Workout tracker is decent. Aside from the preset workout activities you cannot remove.<br> - A selection of free clockfaces to find a display of information to your liking. Its not a very big selection though.<br> - There is a method for adding and paying with credit cards using the device itself. I have not used this however, the security is dubious.<br> - The phone app adds a lot. Its easier to track your calories and water on the phone, you can search from a lot of pre-made entries for common meals, organic breads, meats, etc. Pretty convenient for tracking your calories and water input.<br> - There are a few handy apps you can get for free installed to the watch. Particularly handy is the \\'Find your phone\\' app, for those of us who can\\'t manage to leave it where we can find it.',\n",

Mehrere Foren durchsucht, alles mögliche versucht, hin und her probiert, nichts. So macht es einfach keinen Spaß und nervt. Mein Freund (Informatiker) und ich sind, obwohl gute technische Kenntnisse, einfach schier verzweifelt und ratlos. Auch die offiziellen Helpdesks von Fitbit brachten nicht einen hilfreichen Hinweis...<br>Ich habe die Amazon Exclusive Version der Uhr gehabt, die Farbe haut tatsächlich nicht ganz hin mit der Abbildung, die mehr ins bordeaux ging. Stattdessen ist das Band eher dunkel lila würde ich sagen.<br><br>Edit: Habe nun auf Anraten des Amazon-Supports mit dem Support von Fitbit telefoniert und die Mitarbeiter sind auch ratlos. Geraten wurde mir, die App neu zu starten,Bluetooth einmal aus/an zu machen, Uhr neu starten. Das haben wir ja bereits versucht. Nichts funktionierte. Man sagte mir nun, dass ich probieren soll, die Uhr über ein Gerät meiner Freunde zu koppeln, weil sie wohl sie Bestätigung brauchen, dass es bei beiden Geräten nicht funktioniert.<br><br>Edit 2: Nach erneutem Anrufen und Versuchen der Verbindung weiterhin kein Verbindungsaufbau möglich. Allerdings ist mir der Mitarbeiter entgegengekommen und hat mir einen Link geschickt, damit ich ein neues Produkt erhalte. Hierzu musste ich ein Formular online ausfüllen, war recht unkompliziert. Ich warte die Bestellung ab und werde dann nochmal berichten.<br><br>Edit 3: Heute nun mein insgesamt 3. Anruf beim Fitbit Support. Via Email wurde mir mitgeteilt, dass ich angeblich einen anderen Namen eingetragen hätte im Auftragsformular (Ich habe einen Doppelnamen, der durch einen Bindestrich getrennt wird, damit hatte das Formular Probleme, daher habe ich eine Leerzeile verwendet). Mir wurde nun gesagt, dass ich irgendwann in den nächsten Tagen (man konnte mir hier kein Datum nennen) eine Email mit weiteren Informationen zugeschickt bekomme...<br><br>Edit 4: Tatsächlich ging der Auftrag sehr schnell raus und zwei Tage später wurde mir eine neue Fitbit zugeschickt (kein ganzes OVP Gerät, sondern die Uhr. Immerhin bin ich bei der ersten Anmeldung und Verbindungsversuchen schon wesentlich weitergekommen als bisher, allerdings haperte es dann, weil meine Fitbit App dann immer abgeschmiert ist (die Uhr war schon mit der Installation und Einrichtung fertig und das Handy zeigte die ganze Zeit \"wird installiert\" an - den Spaß haben wir in verschiedensten Formen und Varianten über Stunden ausprobiert ohne nennenswerte Ergebnisse.<br>Schließlich haben wir unseren Durchbruch dann erzielen können, indem wir die Fitbit via USB an den PC angeschlossen haben (kein Bluetooth-PC), hier war die Einrichtung dann auf Handy und App innerhalb weniger Minuten abgeschlossen und funktionierte soweit schonmal. Allerdings ist die Synchronisierung via App auf dem Handy der reinste Horror, lädt minutenlang und nichts passiert, er findet das Gerät nicht und aktualisiert demnach meine erzielten Fortschritte des Tages nicht.<br><br>Fazit: Das Problem scheint definitiv bei der FitBit App zu liegen. Es ist mir schleierhaft, wieso das Produkt vermarktet wird, wenn die App unausgereift ist. Ich werde nun alternativ weitere Apps ausprobieren, die ebenfalls auf die Fitbit zugreifen können, aber ich finde es insgesamt eine Frechheit. Die Handhabung und Verbindungsprobleme haben uns so viel Zeit gekostet wie kaum ein anderes technisches Produkt.<br>Ich erhöhe meine Bewertung auf 2 Sterne nur aufgrund des Supports durch Amazon und FitBit, da die Zustellung eines neuen Gerätes schnell funktioniert hat. Nutzbar ist das Zusammenspiel zwischen App und Uhr jedoch nicht.',\n",

Yesterday screen pops off, lucky I had gotten the warranty that Amazon offer, tried to submit a claim. They stated I need the serial number. I thought it would be on the info booklets it came with. Nope. Thought it was at least on the watch itself. Nope. It should have been at least inside of the watch, well because the screen is now off easy access. Nope. It's not even on the app where you have to sync it to your phone. Call Fitbit to see if they can give it to me but they somehow don't have access to it but they have access to information I never gave them. Told me it on the box I recycled 2yrs ago.

Dopo venti giorni muore all'improvviso e non riesco ad avere segni di vita. Software veramente imbarazzante. Aggiornamenti impossibili da fare. A volte è pure meglio non farli. Assistenza ancora peggio. Non raggiungibili. Sanno solo ringraziare per averli contattati. Non comprate un dispositivo Fitbit.

       " 'Here is my little story with the Fitbit.  I bought the 1st Generation Fitbit Versa in 2018.  The experience was lackluster to say the least.  Over the year I had to do factory resets and the like about once or twice a month.  A pain mind you but, not game breaking.  It was the 1st generation after all so you need to expect such quirks.  Companies usually rush any tech out these days in order to compete so we are all beta-testers in a sense anyway.<br><br>However, two weeks after the one year warranty ran out the Versa became a brick.  Just refused to work.  I went through all the steps with tech support and they decided I needed a new one but, since the warranty ran out they would only give me a 20% discount on the new Versa 2 that came out.  It was right before Black Friday so I thought I would wait and see if any better sales came about.  I did like the Versa, I liked the idea of what it could do so I wanted to, really wanted to like the product.<br><br>November comes and Eureka!! there is great sales on the Fitbit Versa 2 and I buy one.  Thinking, \"Ok, this is the 2nd generation they worked out all the bugs.\" Yes, I fell into the trap.  In January, Fitbit releases a patch that bricks a lot of the Versa 2 models.  Looking at the forums I was reading hundreds of very unhappy people.  Calling tech support they tried to fix it but, in the end just sent me a new one.  Overall not a bad experience.<br><br>Now, here I sit today, almost five months after my replacement.  I have to either force stop my app and restart it, or completely shut off the phone and watch and hope it re sync\\'s, or do a complete factory reset almost everyday.  At least three times a week.  This little watch has become more of a pain than any tech I own.  I loved the idea of this watch and really, really wanted to like it but, it seems we, as customers, are still in the \"beta\" testing phase.<br><br>I am going to give up on most of the watches capabilities with the app and just wear it as a semi-smart watch.  It still give steps and heart rate and tells the time but, it will only sync if \"IT\" decides it wants to.  I imagine it will finally just stop syncing one day and slowly fade away.  I definitely won\\'t be buying the 3rd generation if there is one.  When the watch finally dies it will be off to a different brand.',\n",

I liked the idea of being able to pay for things with my watch however I found out after it arrived that it basically doesn’t support any UK high street branch. If you are with HSBC, Virgin, Santander, Monzo, Yorkshire Bank, NatWest, Halifax  First Direct or nationwide you can forget paying for things on your watch - if you want that you really need an Apple Watch. Music - another disappointment, only supports Deezer (does anyone use this???) or Apple Music subscription. You can’t play your iTunes without downloading onto the watch from the computer (pain in the arse), Spotify or Amazon musics = nope not those either. The Alexa feature on it is clunky - you have to select Alexa from the top of the screen - so if your in the middle of any exercise, it’s basically pointless, it doesn’t have ‘always listening’. It doesn’t support any of the fitness apps you may actually want to use like Nike training club, instead you have to choose from the very limited, cheap apps that it has on its list which is very very very restrictive. And if your interested in your running, fitness and overall wellness- you would be 100 times better getting a Garmin. My brother In law got his Garmin two weeks after I got this and I’ll be honest, I was gutted when I saw how much better his was than mine and price wise he paid the same for his watch as I paid for mine. I’d have swapped it in an instant without a second through. Design wise - well it’s not the nicest looking watch is it? It looks cheap especially with the plastic straps that make it look like a child’s watch. Not really what I wanted when I wear it all day to my corporate job then go to a health club to workout. The app though is very simple to use, very clear and I do like the women’s health (period tracker) section which is an absolute God send when trying to plan weekends away around aunt flow.

I contacted Fitbit, got the latest upgrades, but nothing changed. I put on another old fitness watch at the same time and the Fitbit counted anywhere from 4,000 to 12,000 extra steps depending on my activity.

The functionality of the product is VERY limited really, I view it as basically a plain Jane smart(ish) wrist watch that really only reminds you to be more cognizant of just how lazy you are.

In fact we back when fitbit first came out....I had purchased one of the first couple of originals. And it was the same thing. I compare this with both my garmins that are very basic yes.... However they are both very accurate. And only changing the battery once a year sometimes a year-and-a-half actually is a huge plus. Nonetheless I wanted to try the new fitbit's out and it's nice you don't have to charge it for every 5 days. Which isn't too bad. But I can't get past the inaccuracy. I was not feeling well a couple days ago and I know for a fact I never reached my step goal but according to Fitbit I did. so then I measured it up against the two garments. Fitbit was off fitbit over a thousand!  It's too bad because I really wanted to love this watch, activity tracker rather. The sleep is accurate but no more accurate than my Garmin. I was just hoping to find something with a big display it had a few more fun features. The other thing the Fitbit versa 2....<br>It does not record flights of stairs as accurately as I hoped either.

Und eine Lebenserwartung von 2 Jahren, finde ich doch sehr happig für den Preis.<br><br>———————-<br><br>Originaltext:<br><br>Vorab will ich anmerken, dass ich grundsätzlich total begeistert bin von dieser Uhr! Warum dann also diese schlechte Bewertung? Meine Uhr ist mir nun bereits zum 2. Mal kaputt gegangen. Beim ersten Mal wurde mir schnell und unkompliziert einfach eine neu zugesandt - sehr kundenfreundlich und kulant!! Leider ist aber diese nun auch nicht mehr funktionsfähig. Daher wieder beim Support angerufen und diesmal musste ich sie einschicken. Keine Ahnung, ob ich schlichtweg Pech hatte oder ob diese Uhren wie ein rohes Ei behandelt werden müssen?! Jedoch erwarte ich von einer Uhr, dass sie den Alltag übersteht und ich nicht ständig Angst haben muss, dass sie am Ende des Tages kaputt ist.<br><br>Ansonsten kann ich nur sagen, dass die Uhr mich komplett abgeholt hat. Das Einrichten geht mit der Anleitung sehr einfach und unkompliziert. Die Bedienung ist intuitiv und simpel. Die vorhandenen Features entsprachen voll und ganz meinen Erwartungen. Lediglich beim Schrittzähler habe ich den Eindruck, dass z.B. während des Autofahrens immer wieder mal Schritte berechnet werden. Sprich die Schritterkennung funktioniert nicht zu 100%. So habe ich an einem Spieleabend dank eines Würfelspiels locker mehrere Tausend Schritte gemacht. Relevant ist dieser Punkt jedoch nur für diejenigen, die mit Hilfe der Uhr abnehmen wollen. Und damit kommen wir zum für mich größten Pluspunkt! Die eingebaute Kalorinberechnung hilft mir selber dabei die Weihnachtspfunde wieder abzubauen. Schritte werden sichtbar mit mehr kcal belohnt. Dadurch achtet man (ich jedenfalls) bewusster auf die tägliche Bewegung. Sei es nun in Form von Joggen, spazieren gehen oder einfach nur so zwischendurch mal ein paar mehr Schritte, weil man am Ende des Tages sein selber gewähltes (und in der App eingestelltes) Tagesziel erreichen will.<br><br>Zusammengefasst kann ich nur noch mal betonen, dass mir die Uhr wirklich sehr gefällt. Ich hoffe sehr, dass meine Ersatzuhr zeitnahe ankommt und vor allem diesmal langlebiger ist! Sollte sie dieses eine (leider sehr wichtige) Kriterium erfüllen, würde ich ohne Bauchschmerzen 5 Sterne verteilen. Aktuell jedoch ist es eher deprimierend und die 2 Sterne kommen nur aufgrund der sehr schnellen und kulanten Zusendung einer Ersatzuhr beim 1. Mal zustande.',\n",

The photos above are of the screen, less than a minute after a shutdown/reset. A few minutes later the screen flickers that much making it extremely difficult to see the apps. After searching the web for a possible fix for the problem, I found that this issue seems to be a regular occurrence. The advice given was to shutdown and reboot at least 3 times, but many people like myself who tried this found it did not resolve the issue.

I had to see a cardiologist due to the readings it was giving me only to find out they were wrong and I was fine. It jumps by 30 to 50bpm off all the time.

There's no way they'll process and ship it back to me within one month of me sending it to them.<br><br>In summary, for the one year warranty period since my original purchase in mid-June 2020, I'll have been without it for two months total.

Alas, the optimistic product description belies some pretty huge limitations.<br><br>Firstly, there are serious limitations on what media you can put on the watch. The product description says you can \"control spotify, download Pandora stations and add Deezer playlists\". The devil is in the details here - firstly, you can\\'t download any of your Spotify content to the watch itself, so you\\'ll need to have your phone with you if you want to listen via Spotify. It\\'s just a glorified remote control for Spotify. For Pandora you only get \\'stations\\' - playlists pre-made by Pandora which, for the most part, aren\\'t very good. Deezer is the best - at least you can make your own playlists - but whenever I hit the \\'play\\' button on the watch, the only thing that happens is it disconnects my speakers (I\\'ve tried several speakers). So, too buggy to use, at least for me.<br><br>Secondly, note that there\\'s no podcast support. Neither Pandora stations nor Deezer playlists can contain podcasts. So you either have to download playlists and upload them manually via the FitBit Connect app, or you have no podcasts.

I'm looking more to Garmin at this time. I've also found the step tracker to not be accurate at all. It counts steps while you are driving and has even counted steps while sitting and eating!

Am Anfang war ich schon genervt, da es Probleme mit der Verbindung und Installation gab, Handy und Uhr wollten sich nicht Verbinden, dann hat die Uhr mein Handy eingefroren weil die App gecrashed ist. Zwei Dinge die mich am meisten stören: einmal die App selbst, sie läuft nicht flüssig! Jeden scheiß Tag muss ich mein Handy neu starten weil die App nix laden kann, entweder sie läd sich ein Wolf, oder es wird gar nix mehr angezeigt. Man zahlt 135euro für ne Uhr nur damit die App spinnt, good job. Außerdem muss man ein Monats Abo abschließen, damit man alle funktionen nutzen darf x) Man kauft also eine Uhr für 135euro+ um dann die abgespeckte version nutzen zu dürfen bis man sich Premium kauft x)))<br>zu Premium gehören schon simple funktionen wie, Rezepte für lowcarb kram oder workouts,.. oder aber die Möglichkeit mit anderen nutzern zu interagieren mit Sport.. wow ich kann chatten über die app mit männern mittleren alters, genau dafür habe ich sie gekauft... Die Uhr hatte ich mal ne weile als Test am Fußgelenk getragen, weil ich echt schiss hatte sie bekommt bei der arbeit kratzer. Ich saß auf dem Sofa und hab mit dem Fuß ein bisschen gewippt, da zeigte die uhr dann einen Puls von 136 an und hat das als Pilates gewertet, okeee. Ich bin sehr unzufrieden! JEDER der sich überlegt die watch zu kaufen muss sich darüber klar sein, dass weitere Kosten auf einen zukommen, wenn man denn alle Funktionen nutzen möchte und das die App, die essentiell für die Nutzung der Uhr ist nicht ordnungsgemäß funktioniert.

What am I meant to do with a strapless watch?<br><br>Even after watching dozens of YouTube videos and reading help articles, the strap won't go in. Physically impossible.

       " 'I just returned this device today after appropriately two weeks of use. I really wanted to like this fitness tracker and the device itself does a good job at what it is advertised to do.; however, the Fitbit App (which the Versa 2 needs to interact with in order to function properly) drains my phone battery at a vastly accelerated rate (Note 8). I was getting two days phone battery life before having to charge my phone; after the Fitbit app I needed to charge twice a day. I looked on line and it seems this is a known issue but the Fitbit folks have not rolled out an update with a fix to their App yet. I tried the \"fixes\" listed online and at first it seemed to work..no bluetooth unless manually syncing plus some other features turned off which of course kind of defeats the convenience of having a tracker at all. The Fitbit Customer service rep didn\\'t know about (or wasn\\'t allowed to acknowledge the problem) and gave me no suitable answers or help.<br>At this current time I can not recommend this Tracker until they get a fix to their App.<br>The Device itself is nice looking but sits rather high on your wrist. It is comfortable enough to wear over night for monitoring sleep and it \"seems\" to be fairly accurate at estimating your sleep time and quality. Steps also seem to be fairly accurate but it will count anything you move your arm doing as a step (counted rocking in my recliner as steps - ha). Alexa worked as was advertised but it works in collaboration with the Alexa App on your phone so you need your phone within bluetooth range which I found I couldn\\'t do because of the phone battery issue. The battery life of the Versa 2 itself is great. I did get a full 4 days. You may not have the issues with your phone that I did but I would check the comments on the Fitbit community review site to see what is said about the latest developments before purchasing.',\n",

Unfortunately it was recalled so I bought a Sense which has GPS but required a subscription to a 3rd party vendor for music.  Tried the Versa 2 which did allow you to store your own music.  However, while it had GPS it was not clear in the product description that it only had \"connected GPS\" which requires you to have your phone handy -- not really practical for running or taking hikes in areas without cellular access.  While the health metrics on the Versa 2 are pretty good, some of the support seems to being phased out to encourage customers to move to the Versa 3 or Sense --neither of which have independent music storage -- Does Fitbit get a cut from the 3rd party vendors which charge around $10/mo for a subscription?',\n",
       " 'Since I bought my Fitbit I have really loved it. I was more interested in working out with it especially since it was noted it is water resistant I knew I could swim. I was hesitant about getting water in it though. The first time I went swimming it congratulated me for the work through the app. The second time I went swimming the watch couldn’t get on. It just died. I’m very disappointed especially thinking of the money I spent. It’s less than a year.',\n",

It is intermittent but has gotten progressively worse.  While the Versa keeps tracking your sleep, steps, etc... the screen is almost always a solid greenish-blue color with no functionality.  Unfortunately, because Fitbit only warrants their trackers for a year, I'm out of luck.  Which sucks because, (1) other than this issue, the watch has been great, and (2) I would expect a watch to last at least 2 years.  Sadly, after searching Fitbits forums it appears this is a known issue and the only resolution is to replace the watch (if you're under warranty).  If your not under warranty, you're out of luck.  I came to Fitbit from a Google OS watch, and it was a HUGE improvement so I plan on giving them one more shot with the Charge 5, but if I only get 2 years out of that one, these might be the last Fitbit products I own.\",\n",

       " 'I purchased the Fitbit Versa 2 to replace my Fitbit Surge which I purchased several years ago.  I love the Surge but it is a bit of a clunky fitness tracker and would routinely get caught up in my jacket or shirt sleeve.  After researching for several weeks I chose the Versa 2.  When I received this fitness tracker I was immediately impressed by the style and the comfort of the fitness tracker.  Set up was easy and the fitness tracker looked great.  I really liked some of the new features such as the fitbit pay and the alexa.  I wore it for  a couple of days and found that the watch strap kept falling off.  I made several attempts to re-attache the strap without success.  After several frustrating minutes of attempting to re attach the strap it would fall off the fitness tracker.  I have large hands so I took it to some female acquaintances who have smaller and more dexterous hands to see if they could re-attach the watch strap.  No success.  The thought was that the watch or the pin on the strap is defective.  I tried again by watching You Tube videos but was still not able to attach the strap.  I could see no visible damage to the strap or the watch itself and concluded that it could not be re-attached.  Obviously, the fitness tracker without the strap is not acceptable which is why I gave the Versa 2 two stars.  For the short time that I was able to wear the Versa 2 it seemed to accurately record the various fitness features.  I was really hoping that this fitness tracker would be an upgrade to my Surge.  As I said earlier the fitness tracker looks great and has many great features but I think I am going to look at other fitness trackers in the future. The product was returned to Amazon.',\n",

Amazing quality, it sits around my wrist very softly I almost forget that its there which is great as I had other sleep trackers before and at night they can be quite uncomfortable but not this one 😊<br>I am quite happy with its function except that when you are on a run or bike ride and its not connected to your phone it will say you have done 0miles. I went onto a 6h bike ride the other day and wanted to track it, although the watch advised to connect it to the phone I ignored it. I had other trackers before that would track without being connected but sadly this one didn’t. so after 6 hours it told me how many calories I have burnt but sadly it didn’t show me how many miles I had cycled. Another thing I am a bit sad about is that it wont allow me to control my music when played via the phone. That would have been a neat function.

I wore out several bands but had no issues otherwise.  My reason for wearing a Fitbit device is exercise related especially to monitor heart rate/bpm since I have heart disease and am on medication. My Versa 2  is all over the place with detecting bpm.  While reading a book I looked at the bpm screen on the device and it was showing 170.  (The book was not that exciting.)  On several occasions during HIIT training sessions I checked and my bpm was 30 or 50 and I would check 30 second later and it was 137. For extended periods of time after exercise but doing absolutely nothing the bpm view was jumping from the mid 60's to the mid 90.  I do perspire and secure the device high and tight as best is possible but still slides down my arm.  I contacted Fitbit help and on both occasions the school solution was to reset the device. Failure on both occasions as the issue continues.  I asked if it was possible if a sensor or whatever detected pulse could be defective - still waiting for a response.  Since resting pulse and calories burned are bpm related I assume those are likely inaccurate.  Parting shot - too many duplicate apps options.  Not likely to purchase another Fitbit device.  Will look for a fitness device not an Apple Watch wanna be.\",\n",

Too many times will my heart be virtually ripping out of my chest and I look at this thing and its either blank, or hilariously telling me 90bpm. I work out hard, potentially too hard for this thing, I feel like the information it gives me in terms of calories burnt and time in certain heart rate zones are off by as much as 40-50%. Its a shame too because I felt like I was buying a higher end model to avoid this situation.

Of course the worst of the issues appeared 13 months after owning, when the warranty is expired. Now the watch randomly shuts off for no reason and has to be restarted in order to show even the time. Also randomly, the watch will use its entire battery in one day and then the next charge it will last for a week. Craziest thing and extremely inconsistent. It can be hours before I look at my watch to realize it’s been off the whole time not tracking anything. It’s never been wet- after reading reviews about it not working properly after getting wet contrary to its advertisement- I even take it off to wash the dishes.

I was very hesitant on the Fitbit versa 2 because it's obviously more for fitness tracking than a smartwatch. I had this watch for all about a day and realized it was not worth $200. Here's why:<br>1. The design of the Fitbit wasn't too big for my wrist but the straps didn't move so it was a little uncomfortable in that aspect.<br>2. There is only one button so it makes it harder to control especially if you've been sweating and it takes a second to scroll to what you're looking for.<br>3. This was the biggest issue for me. Yes there are apps like Spotify and Pandora but what they don't tell you is you need the premium subscription for it all. So not only do you need a subscription for Spotify add-on another few bucks to start it up. I honestly just thought Fitbit was trying to get more money out of everyone.<br>There are other smartwatches out there that have Spotify.<br>4. The Fitbit app on your phone wasn't very user friendly for connecting apps. It was very frustrating to use.<br>5. Alexa sometimes doesn't hear you correctly. She's very limited on commands, which I already knew but I didn't think it would have been this annoying.<br>6. At this point you should be able to at least voice text or send a already created greeting like you can on calls. Maybe you need premium for that but I didn't have it long enough to know.<br><br>Don't get me wrong I might have just wanted more features which ik it's a fitness based watch but even for that I think it's outdated.<br><br>I thought this could be the one but I'd rather pay a little more and get extra features like the Galaxy Active 2 (which is my next watch I'm going to try).\",\n",

At this point, I\\'m really not using it in any useful way - it\\'s just a large black box strapped to my wrist.<br>So I decide I\\'ve tried everything I can on my own and attempt to contact the company. Their Live Chat function fails over and over again over the course of two days. I finally call the customer service line and get a very bored sounding rep who gets irate with me after I tell her that the Live Chats that are logged all failed to stay connected and she gives me a lecture about \"I have a procedure to follow\" and I\\'m told I have to perform a battery test over the course of a day before I can proceed to whatever the next step is (she didn\\'t say and I\\'m too annoyed to ask at this point).<br>If I go forward and do the test and the customer service to resolve the problem improves, I\\'ll certainly consider adjusting my review and rating because that\\'s only fair, but as it stands right now I regret buying the Versa 2 and would be very unlikely to buy from Fitbit again.',\n",

It paired with the FitBit app super easily and everything was working great. Then by Day 2 the fun started. I woke up in the morning, saw my sleep info, and then it stopped syncing. It wouldn\\'t reconnect, so I followed all the steps I could find online, eventually uninstalling and reinstalling the app to get it to work. Then it worked for a few hours and stopped again. For the last few days if I wanted any data to sync I\\'d have to repeat this process. I finally decided to download an older version of the app, and that worked for a day, but back to the same thing. FitBit released an app update yesterday and I thought MAYBE this will work. Nope! Not only does it not work, but my watch won\\'t pair with the app AT ALL. When setting up the watch it \"finds it\" and then connects for a really long time before giving me the \"not working\" message. If you can find the watch, why can\\'t it pair?? I don\\'t get it. As much as I want this watch, not having a workable app makes it no better than a standard watch.

Übersichtlich und intuitiv zu verwenden. Dass manche Inhalte nur für Abonennten verfügbar sind, ist etwas schade.<br>- Display: Satter Schwarzton. Pixel auf normale Entfernung zum Auge nicht zu erkennen.<br><br>Jetzt jedoch die negativen Eigenschaften, die mich letztlich zu einer Rücksendung bewegt haben:<br>- Smartwatch-Funktionen: Hier habe ich nicht viel erwartet, es hapert jedoch schon an den Basics: Alte Benachrichtigungen tauchen wieder auf, Nachrichten werden nicht ganz dargestellt, beim Klick auf \"öffnen\" verschwinden sie. Verbindung zu Spotify funktioniert nur sporadisch. Hue App funktioniert gar nicht. Kalender wird nicht eingelesen (obwohl ich hier nicht sicher bin, ob das ein Android/Outlook Problem ist). An sich wäre das verkraftbar, da ich eigentlich primär einen Fitness Tracker haben wollte.<br>- Tracking-Funktionen: Leider sind sowohl der Schrittezähler als auch der Etagenzähler sehr ungenau.

Most of the time my touch screen was none responsive and the device would randomly restart multiple times throughout the day and night; as a result, it did not accurately track/record steps or hours slept. Half of the time, my screen was black; when this happens, tapping the screen and/or pushing the button wouldn’t activate the device. Fitbit help forums page suggest resetting the device, easier said than done, since you must scroll over to the setting icon to reset the device, which is not possible since the touch screen in non responsive. I should not have to reset/restore my device daily in order for it to work properly. The fact that the Versa 2 allows Android users to send quick responses to text message is testament that the function exists, so why can’t users who own an iPhone do the same? Frustrated with the “not ready for prime time” software and the minimal capabilities available to iPhone users, such as myself, I returned my Fitbit Versa 2 and purchased an Apple Watch. As a side note: The Versa have a small number of apps available for download (it’s a fitness tracker not a true smartwatch); If you are looking for more than a fitness tracker disguised as a smartwatch. I suggest you do what I did and purchase a true smartwatch from either Apple or Samsung.',\n",

So, in a nutshell, the versa 2 is a decent smartwatch when it is actually in working condition. Please beware that the build quality of the device is not the best and once you get one replacement, you will get no more help from Fitbit support no matter how long you have had the device.

My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).<br>- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.<br>- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.<br>- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.<br>- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.<br>- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.<br>- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.<br>- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it.\",\n",

I\\'m not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.<br><br>Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!<br><br>I don\\'t have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It\\'s totally fun.<br><br>Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can\\'t easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like \"Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki...\" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called \"Ai Watan\" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today\\'s teens. And this won\\'t change.<br><br>Update: January 10, 2021<br>Almost two years since purchase<br><br>The device is still as good as it was when bought. However, it seems Amazon has made no efforts to improve their music libraries. Their focus is still only to cater to the youth, not those who love soft soulful music. When I ask Alexa to play songs of Md. Rafi, for example, she will only play noisy ones like \"Chaahe koyi mujhe jungle kahe...\". She will never include songs like \"Ik haseen shaam ko dil mera kho gayaa...\" even if the song is available in Amazon Music. The Amazon team thinks only college goers listen to its music.

Alexa doesn\\'t understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say \"Alexa\" first for everything, and it also doesn\\'t understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?--&gt;it just says I don\\'t know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.<br>Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills\\' library so you can automate/routine many things.<br><br>On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.<br><br>I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose.',\n",

There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart!  Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb.
